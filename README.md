# Isometric-Raytracer

This project was created purely to look cool and to explore the graphical limitations of the HTML5 canvas element.

The project contains just 2 files: a HTML file and a JavaScript file. Put them in the same folder and run the HTML file in a browser to demo the project.

The project is still largely unfinished, but the current version works as a proof of concept, rotating just under half a million pixels on the screen. I'll add a few benchmarks at a later date, but it should hit at least 40 FPS on a decent computer.
